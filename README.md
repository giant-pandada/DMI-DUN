# DMI-DUN: A Densely Multi-Scale Interactive Deep Unfolding Network for Compressive Sensing

## Test
Set the sampling rate and dataset for the test in the eval.py.

Place the test dataset into the "./dataset/test/" folder and Place the pretrained models into the "./results/" folder.

## Train
Replace the path to the train dataset in the loader.py.

Place the train dataset into the folder you set in the loader.py.

The model parameters will be saved under the name "model.pth" in the "./results/{cs_ratio}/models/" folder.

## Pretrained Models
